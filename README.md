## Getting Started

The goal of this app is to:
- Visualise live predestian data of Helsinki
- Visualize live public transportation data

To achieve this, we used the data from the available Beacon API:
- Node.js, Jupyter -> to harvest the data
- Google Cloud -> to get the closes routes between stations
- Flutter -> to visualize and build a cross-platform mobile app
